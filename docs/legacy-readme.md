**MUIDSI Hackathon 2026** | Agriculture/Plant Track Team: Pierce (AI/ML Lead), Alfiya (Data Pipeline + EDA), Suyog (Feature Engineering + ML), Christophe (Problem Framing + Pitch)

**AgriFlow** is a multi-agent AI system built for the **MUIDSI Hackathon 2026** that helps food distribution planners address agricultural risk and food insecurity across Missouri. It combines LangGraph agentic orchestration, machine learning, real-time data from federal APIs, and an interactive React dashboard into a single conversational intelligence platform.

> Ask AgriFlow anything about Missouri food supply chains — it reasons across crop data, census demographics, disaster history, weather, and trained ML models to give actionable answers with charts, maps, and delivery routes.

---

## What It Does

AgriFlow answers natural-language questions like:

- *"Which Missouri counties have the highest food insecurity and what drives it?"*
- *"Train an XGBoost risk model and show feature importance for a 30% corn yield drop"*
- *"Optimize a delivery route from Cape Girardeau Hub to Wayne, Pemiscot, and Dunklin counties"*
- *"Are there any current crop disease outbreaks in Missouri I should know about?"*
- *"Show a choropleth map of food desert risk across southeastern Missouri"*
- *"Run a full analytics pipeline under a drought scenario with anomaly detection and web research"*

## Machine Learning Methodology

Our ML pipeline was developed and validated across four Jupyter notebooks before being implemented as production Python tools.

### County-Level Risk Modeling (Suyog / NEW1 Notebooks)

Validated on **115 Missouri counties** with **38 features** from USDA Food Environment Atlas:

| Model | R2 | RMSE | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Gradient Boosting | 0.998 | 0.099 | Best overall — production default |
| Random Forest | 0.987 | — | Strong non-linear baseline |
| Linear Regression | 0.983 | 0.328 | Interpretable baseline |
| SVR (RBF, C=10) | 0.912 | 0.746 | Alternative interpretable |

**4 validated interaction features** (all rank top-15 predictors):
- `POVxSNAP` = POVRATE21 x PCT_SNAP22
- `POVxLACCESS` = POVRATE21 x LACCESS_HHNV19
- `FOODxIncome` = FOODINSEC_21_23 / MEDHHINC21
- `SNAPxLACCESS` = PCT_SNAP22 x LACCESS_HHNV19

**Top predictors**: PCT_WICWOMEN16 (~65%), VLFOODSEC_21_23 (~22%), FOODINSEC_18_20 (~5%)

**3 K-Means clusters** (k=3): High-Risk, Low-Risk, Access-Constrained — each with distinct intervention strategy.

### Census-Tract Risk Modeling (NEW2 Notebook)

Validated on **72,242 US census tracts** (1,387 for Missouri):

- **Economic Hardship Index (EHI)** = SNAP_rate + HUNV_rate
- **Structural Inequality Index (SII)** = Black_pct + Hispanic_pct - White_pct
- **Aging Index (AI)** = Senior_pct
- **GBM model**: R2 = 0.9949, RMSE = 0.0033 (target: SNAP_rate)
- **Composite risk score**: `Food_Insecurity_Risk = (EHI_norm + Pred_SNAP_norm) / 2` in [0,1]
- **Highest-risk tract**: 29510111300 (St. Louis city), risk = 0.959

| ML | XGBoost, Scikit-learn (GBM, RF, SVR, Isolation Forest), SHAP |
| Data processing | Pandas, NumPy, SciPy |
| Visualization | Plotly |
| Backend API | FastAPI, Uvicorn (SSE streaming) |
| Frontend | React + Vite |
| Database | SQLite (USDA + Census + FEMA) |
| MCP protocol | FastMCP (5 servers) |
| Cloud agents | Archia (console.archia.app) |
| Web search | DuckDuckGo DDGS |
| External APIs | USDA NASS, Census ACS, FEMA, Open-Meteo |

## Performance

| Query Type | Typical Latency | LLM |
|------------|-----------------|-----|
| Simple data lookup | 1-3 s | Haiku |
| Chart generation | 2-5 s | Haiku |
| Route optimization | 2-4 s | Haiku |
| ML model training | 10-30 s | Sonnet |
| Full analytics pipeline | 30-90 s | Sonnet |

The smart router (pure Python regex, no LLM) fast-tracks single-category queries directly to tool execution, saving 1-3 s per query.

## Hackathon Context — MUIDSI 2026

AgriFlow was developed for the **MU Institute for Data Science and Informatics (MUIDSI) Hackathon 2026**, themed around AI-driven solutions to agricultural and food supply chain challenges in Missouri.

### Problem Statement

Missouri has 115 counties with varying degrees of food insecurity, crop dependency, and infrastructure gaps. Food distribution planners need tools that can:
1. Identify the most vulnerable counties and census tracts
2. Predict risk under drought or supply-disruption scenarios
3. Optimize delivery logistics for emergency food distribution
4. Stay current on crop diseases, weather alerts, and policy changes

### Our Approach

We built a conversational AI system that sits on top of all relevant federal data sources (USDA, Census, FEMA) and trained ML models. Planners can ask natural-language questions and receive structured answers with charts, maps, and delivery routes — no data science expertise required.

The ML models were developed iteratively through four research notebooks, validated against federal data, and then embedded directly into the agentic tool layer so that any query can trigger model inference on demand.
